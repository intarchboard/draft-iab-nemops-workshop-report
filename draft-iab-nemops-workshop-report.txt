   Report from the IAB Workshop on the Next Era of Network Management

Abstract

   The "Next Era of Network Management Operations (NEMOPS)" workshop was
   convened by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) on December 3-5,
   2024 as a three-day online meeting.  It builds on a previous 2002
   workshop, the outcome of which was documented in RFC 3535 identifying
   14 operator requirements for consideration in future network
   management protocol design and related data models, along with some
   recommendations for the IETF.  Much has changed in the Internet’s
   operation and technological foundations since then.  The NEMOPS
   workshop reviewed the past outcomes and identified any operational
   barriers that prevented these technologies from being widely
   implemented.  It sketched new requirements for future network
   management operations collaboratively with the industry, network
   operators and protocol engineers, and developed a suggested action
   plan and recommendations for the IETF.

   Note that this document is a report on the proceedings of the
   workshop.  The views and positions documented in this report were
   expressed during the workshop by participants and do not necessarily
   reflect IAB's views and positions.

1.  Introduction

   The IAB organized a workshop in June 2002 to establish a dialog
   between network operators and protocol developers, and to guide IETF
   when working on network management protocols.  The outcome of that
   workshop was documented in the "Overview of the 2002 IAB Network
   Management Workshop" [RFC3535] which identified 14 operator
   requirements for consideration in future network management protocol
   design and related data models, along with some recommendations for
   the IETF.

   Those requirements were instrumental in developing first the NETCONF
   protocol (in the NETCONF Working Group) [RFC6241], the associated
   YANG data modeling language (in the NETMOD Working Group) [RFC7950],
   RESTCONF [RFC8040], and most recently CORECONF [I-D.ietf-core-comi].

   The NEMOPS workshop aimed to discuss the following key topics:

   *  Review the outcomes and results of the 2002 workshop (current
      deployments, state of the art) and identify any operational
      barriers that prevent these technologies from being widely
      implemented (limitations, hurdles).

   *  Sketch new requirements for future network management operations
      in a collaborative manner with the industry, network operators,
      and protocol engineers.

   *  Develop a plan of action and recommendations for the IETF.

1.1.  About this workshop report content

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops
   designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the
   Internet, and to suggest future directions for the Internet
   architecture.  This long-term planning function of the IAB is
   complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by working
   groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

   This document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop.  The
   views and positions documented in this report are expressed during
   the workshop by participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB's
   views and positions.

   Furthermore, the content of the report comes from presentations given
   by workshop participants and notes taken during the discussions,
   without interpretation or validation.  Thus, the content of this
   report follows the flow and dialogue of the workshop but does not
   necessarily attempt to capture a consensus, unless stated otherwise.

2.  Workshop Scope and Discussion

   The workshop was organized across three days with all-group
   discussion slots, one per day.  The following topic areas were
   identified and the program committee organized paper submissions into
   three main themes for each of the three discussion slots.  During
   each discussion, those papers were presented sequentially with open
   discussion held at the end of each day.

2.1.  Session I: Past (lookback, analysis)

2.2.  Session II: Present (identified problems & requirements)

2.3.  Session III: Future (possible solutions, recommendations and next
      steps)
