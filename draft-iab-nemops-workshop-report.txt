Abstract

   The "Next Era of Network Management Operations (NEMOPS)" workshop was
   convened by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) on December 3-5,
   2024 as a three-day online meeting.  It builds on a previous 2002
   workshop, the outcome of which was documented in RFC 3535 identifying
   14 operator requirements for consideration in future network
   management protocol design and related data models, along with some
   recommendations for the IETF.  Much has changed in the Internet’s
   operation and technological foundations since then.  The NEMOPS
   workshop reviewed the past outcomes and identified any operational
   barriers that prevented these technologies from being widely
   implemented.  It sketched new requirements for future network
   management operations collaboratively with the industry, network
   operators and protocol engineers, and developed a suggested action
   plan and recommendations for the IETF.

   workshop.  The views and positions documented in this report were
   expressed during the workshop by participants and do not necessarily

1.  Introduction

   The IAB organized a workshop in June 2002 to establish a dialog
   between network operators and protocol developers, and to guide IETF
   when working on network management protocols.  The outcome of that
   workshop was documented in the "Overview of the 2002 IAB Network
   Management Workshop" [RFC3535] which identified 14 operator
   requirements for consideration in future network management protocol
   design and related data models, along with some recommendations for
   the IETF.

   Those requirements were instrumental in developing first the NETCONF
   protocol (in the NETCONF Working Group) [RFC6241], the associated
   YANG data modeling language (in the NETMOD Working Group) [RFC7950],
   RESTCONF [RFC8040], and most recently CORECONF [I-D.ietf-core-comi].

   The NEMOPS workshop aimed to discuss the following key topics:

   *  Review the outcomes and results of the 2002 workshop (current
      deployments, state of the art) and identify any operational
      barriers that prevent these technologies from being widely
      implemented (limitations, hurdles).

   *  Sketch new requirements for future network management operations
      in a collaborative manner with the industry, network operators,
      and protocol engineers.

   *  Develop a plan of action and recommendations for the IETF.

1.1.  About this workshop report content

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops
   designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the
   Internet, and to suggest future directions for the Internet
   architecture.  This long-term planning function of the IAB is
   complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by working
   groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

   This document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop.  The
   views and positions documented in this report are expressed during
   the workshop by participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB's
   views and positions.

   Furthermore, the content of the report comes from presentations given
   by workshop participants and notes taken during the discussions,
   without interpretation or validation.  Thus, the content of this
   report follows the flow and dialogue of the workshop but does not
   necessarily attempt to capture a consensus, unless stated otherwise.

2.  Outreach and Survey

3.  Workshop Scope and Discussion

   The workshop was organized across three days with all-group
   discussion slots, one per day.  The following topic areas were
   identified and the program committee organized paper submissions into
   three main themes for each of the three discussion slots.  During
   each discussion, those papers were presented sequentially with open
   discussion held at the end of each day.

3.1.  Session I: Past (lookback, analysis)

3.2.  Session II: Present (identified problems & requirements)

3.3.  Session III: Future (possible solutions, recommendations and next
      steps)

3.4.  Key Takeaways

   At the end of the third day the discussion turned to key takeaways
   that had consensus.  In the process of discussion there were some
   realizations where additional work was also needed.

   [XXX: note at this point these are cut and paste from the slides and
   not properly edited/cleaned/moved around]

3.4.1.  Ecosystem conclusions

   These takeaways try to document the general thinking of the
   participants with respect to the entire Network Management ecosystem
   as it exists today.

   1.  The current network management protocols, models and tools still
       fail the ‘ease of use’ requirement.  Participants noted that the
       tools almost matter more than the protocols.

   2.  The overall ecosystem is still fragmented for both protocols and
       data models.  SNMP is still used extensively for monitoring, and
       the CLI is still heavily relied on in in many networks.  Popular
       protocols include SNMP, CLI, NETCONF, RESTCONF, gNMI, etc.

   3.  Documentation about the architecture and usage of the network
       management ecosystem is lacking.  More work is needed to create
       general architecture documentation, deployment guides, tutorials,
       training material, getting started guides.

   4.  Transitioning between network management frameworks is
       challenging, just like it is for transitioning between other
       protocols like IPv4 to IPv6.

   5.  Model-driven network management is generally a success where it
       is implemented and possible to use.

   6.  More easily usable network management tools for the operators are
       needed.  The lack of open source tools are seen as a barrier to
       adoption.  Tools need good use cases, example flows and better
       analysis of when and how they work and have been successful.

3.4.2.  Protocol conclusions

   1.  False: Netconf for configuration has been successful in some
       larger scale deployment

       1.  Let’s discuss this further on list

       2.  Service config?

   2.  Netconf/YANG is not used much (yet?) for monitoring

   3.  False: Full device control and configuration frequently requires
       CLI and screen scraping

   4.  Full coverage of NetConf support on devices is missing

   5.  Polling based solutions are still frequently deployed

3.4.3.  Modeling conclusions

   [XXX: note -- I don't think we talked about this slide much -Wes]

   1.  YANG models can sometimes get too complex (not a fault of the
       language)

   2.  Vendor-specific features need to be exposed through network
       management protocols

   3.  More service-level modeling is needed

       1.  Device level modeling needs to be a building block but is not
           a complete service-level solution

   4.  Network configuration needs to be verifiable

   5.  Multi-vendor compatibility support is required

   6.  Full coverage of YANG models on all devices is missing

   7.  Model translation adaptors may be the best path forward

       1.  Likely off-device

3.4.4.  Standardization conclusions

   1.  More rapid model development procedures are (still) needed

       1.  Faster than how the IETF produces (simple) results today
           (especially models)

       2.  New approaches/methods to make it live outside the RFCs
           should be explored

       3.  Need more predictable timelines

   2.  More focus is needed on scalability of all network management
       roles (monitoring, configuration, notifications)

   3.  We should reduce complexity for future changes to a minimal
       agreed set of core features

       1.  For both protocol and models

   4.  Network management enhancements needs to be backed by operator
       use cases and vendor buy-in

       1.  Vendors and operators should must work together

   5.  An rapid development experiment would be an interesting approach

3.4.5.  Additional work needed

   Here we list the things that the group realized needed significant
   more attention in order to come to conclusion about.
