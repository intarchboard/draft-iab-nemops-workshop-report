Abstract

   The "Next Era of Network Management Operations (NEMOPS)" workshop was
   convened by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) from December 3-5,
   2024 as a three-day online meeting.  It builds on a previous 2002
   workshop, the outcome of which was documented in RFC 3535 identifying
   14 operator requirements for consideration in future network
   management protocol design and related data models, along with some
   recommendations for the IETF.  Much has changed in the Internet’s
   operation and technological foundations since then.  The NEMOPS
   workshop reviewed the past outcomes and discussed any operational
   barriers that prevented these technologies from being widely
   implemented.  With the industry, network operators and protocol
   engineers working in collaboration, the workshop developed a
   suggested plan of action and network management recommendations for
   the IETF and IRTF.

1.  Introduction

   The IAB organized a workshop in 2002 to establish a dialog between
   network operators and protocol developers, and to guide the IETF's
   work on network management protocols.  The outcome of that workshop
   was documented in the "Overview of the 2002 IAB Network Management
   Workshop" [RFC3535] which identified 14 operator requirements and 11
   recommendations for consideration in future network management
   protocol design and related data models within the IETF.

   Those requirements were instrumental in developing first the NETCONF
   protocol (in the NETCONF Working Group) [RFC6241], the associated
   YANG data modeling language (in the NETMOD Working Group) [RFC7950],
   RESTCONF [RFC8040], and most recently CORECONF [I-D.ietf-core-comi].

   The recent NEMOPS IAB workshop focussed on the following key tasks:

   *  Review the outcomes and results of the 2002 workshop (current
      deployments, state of the art) and identify any operational
      barriers that prevent these technologies from being widely
      implemented (limitations, hurdles).

   *  Sketch new requirements for future network management operations
      in a collaborative manner with the industry, network operators,
      and protocol engineers.

   *  Develop a plan of action and recommendations for the IETF.

1.1.  About this workshop report content

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops
   designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the
   Internet, and to suggest future directions for the Internet
   architecture.  This long-term planning function of the IAB is
   complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by working
   groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

   This document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop.  The
   views and positions documented in this report are expressed during
   the workshop by participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB's
   views and positions.

   Furthermore, the content of the report comes from presentations given
   by workshop participants and notes taken during the discussions,
   without interpretation or validation.  Thus, the content of this
   report follows the flow and dialogue of the workshop but does not
   necessarily attempt to capture a consensus, unless stated otherwise.

2.  Outreach and Survey

   There has been a noticeable decline, since the last workshop, in the
   direct participation of network operators in the IETF and its
   associated discussions on network management protocols and
   operations.  Many operators prioritize operational conferences such
   as RIPE, NANOG, APRICOT, LACNIC, AutoConn, etc over attending
   standards development organizations (SDOs) like the IETF.

   To address this, the IAB workshop's Program Committee (PC) planned
   outreach initiatives to foster discussions and gather interest by
   engaging with operators at these operational venues and conducting
   information/requirement-gathering sessions.  Participants were
   encouraged to submit "position papers" or "expressions of interest"
   to join the workshop.  Additionally, a [SURVEY] was conducted to
   collect valuable insights to inform the workshop.

   The PC continued to engage with network operators after the workshop
   to facilitate information sharing and gather their feedback, helping
   to shape the next steps and outcomes of the workshop.

3.  Workshop Scope and Discussion

   The workshop was organized across three days with all participants
   contributing to one discussion per day.  The workshop was organized
   around three topic areas: "Session I: the Past (lookback and
   analysis)" (Section 3.1), "Session II: Present (identified problems
   and requirements)" (Section 3.2), and "Session III: Future (possible
   solutions, recommendations and next steps)" (Section 3.3).  The
   program committee organized the paper submissions to fit these three
   main themes in order to drive discussion during each of the slots.
   During each discussion, the papers were presented sequentially and an
   open discussion was held afterwards.  On the last day, an additional
   discussion on the key takeaways from the workshop and possible next
   steps took place (Section 3.4).

3.1.  Session I: Past (lookback, analysis)

   The first day of the workshop focused on reflecting on the past by
   reviewing the evolution of network management since the 2002
   workshop, analyzing both the successes and the challenges encountered
   along the way.  The presentations covered a range of topics,
   including reflections on the history of network management, lessons
   learned from widely used tools, practices in constrained networks,
   and the need to reconsider how network management models and
   protocols are standardized within the IETF.

3.1.1.  Reflections

   The workshop began by reflecting on the IAB’s role in shaping the
   evolution of network management away from CLI/SNMP/MIB technologies,
   focusing on the context and key outcomes of the previous workshop, an
   assessment of the current state of network management as a whole, and
   an acknowledgement of some regrets in how network management
   technologies developed in the last two decades (such as XML as the
   data representation format).  [SCHONWALDER] emphasized the need to
   shift the focus from device-level configuration to network and
   service-level configuration.  Key properties highlighted for
   effective network and service configurations included being
   Composable (assembled out of modular configurations), Declarative
   (define state while systems determine themselves how to implement
   those goals), Reproducible (reliably and consistently recreated), and
   Verifiable (asserting that the correct changes have been applied).

   An operator’s perspective highlighted that the recommendations of
   [RFC3535] (which led to the development of YANG and NETCONF) have
   been successful in addressing device configuration in many, but not
   all, environments.  In certain areas, the advancements in semantics
   and protocols for streaming telemetry have even surpassed the
   original scope of [RFC3535].  [FARRER] cautioned against making
   changes that could disrupt the ecosystem.  The presentation
   emphasized the need to prioritize service modeling in the IETF and
   addressed the challenges of mapping to the Business Support Systems
   (BSS) domain.  It also stressed the importance of including the
   operational state in service models to enable closed-loop automation
   for end-to-end (E2E) services.  Revisiting [RFC8309], which asserts
   that the operational state of a service is not part of a customer
   service model but can be achieved through extensions, was suggested.
   Additionally, the lack of open-source NMS implementations, tools, and
   device model implementations was identified as a significant barrier
   to advancing standardization efforts.  The IETF could play a key role
   in fostering and enabling collaborations to address these challenges
   including an off-box translation tool of the IETF device model to
   vendor proprietary models.

3.1.2.  Lessons to be Learned

   [HARDAKER] emphasized that the success of Net-SNMP [NET-SNMP] was
   driven by empowering users through simplicity.  He stressed that the
   focus should remain on ensuring ease of use and adaptability of the
   protocols.  Emphasis was placed on the two distinct audiences for
   standardized network management protocols: toolkit vendors and system
   operators.  Their requirements for protocol simplicity differ, and it
   is essential to address the needs of both to ensure success.
   [BORMANN] presented an overview of the CORECONF architecture,
   showcasing how model-driven network management techniques can be
   applied to manage IoT devices (which is different from other network
   management scenarios), with a focus on the unique characteristics of
   constrained nodes.  Some participants noted that the binary encoding
   of CBOR has applications that extend beyond the IoT networks.

   Drawing from the experience of OpenConfig [OPENCONFIG], [SHAKIR]
   emphasized that protocol definition and data models cannot be done in
   isolation.  It must integrate lessons learned from implementation and
   large-scale deployment.  He highlighted the importance of enabling
   quick iterations, shipping rapidly, embracing open-source, readily
   available tools, adopting systems thinking driven by business
   outcomes, and reusing existing technologies rather than developing
   solutions exclusively for operator network management.  A call was
   made for IETF to rethink the approach to standardize data models and
   the associated network management protocols under this guidance.

3.1.3.  Discussion

   The Session I open discussion highlighted the divergence between
   vendor implementations of YANG models and what is accessible via it,
   particularly when compared to CLI.  Questions were raised about how
   to incorporate fast iteration and rapid changes within the
   established IETF process and culture, especially in contrast to the
   approach used by OpenConfig.  Common challenges identified included
   lack of tooling, performance issues at scale, the steep learning
   curve for network management protocols/models/tools, initial
   difficulty in moving away from CLI, and the backward compatibility of
   models (versioning).  Some participants suggested that the IETF
   should focus on system-level APIs that address specific problems.
   Additionally, the lack of simple tools for smaller networks operating
   under tight timelines and budgets was emphasized.  A key question
   raised was whether the proliferation of protocols and languages
   complicates adoption, and if converging on a single approach would
   improve adoption.  The existence of multiple schemas and protocols
   beyond NETCONF, such as BMP and IPFIX, to address network management
   challenges beyond configuration is an established reality.  One
   conclusion was that a mechanism was needed to interconnect and
   harmonize these schemas to provide a cohesive and comprehensive
   understanding of the data.

3.2.  Session II: Present (identified problems & requirements)

   The second day of the workshop concentrated on challenges and
   emerging requirements for future network management operations.  The
   presentation emphasized the importance of validation, observability,
   automation, and the need for agile, incremental development of both
   network models and management protocols.  A compilation of new
   requirements is being maintained in
   [I-D.boucadair-nmop-rfc3535-20years-later].  The final presentation
   of the day provided a summary of the survey results and operator
   feedback gathered from outreach events.

3.2.1.  Operator Feedback

   [KELLER] shared Deutsche Telekom’s perspective, emphasizing that
   while YANG models perform well for provisioning, they currently fall
   short in providing the operational stability required for validation.
   While the IETF service models — where available, are considered
   stable and in good condition, the OpenConfig device models were noted
   as lacking feature richness and stability.  In contrast, vendor YANG
   models are often more flexible and available in a more timely manner.
   Achieving fully closed-loop automated and autonomous networking will
   require a greater focus on observability, particularly through
   advancements in streaming telemetry with the "on-change" feature
   [RFC9196].

   [JIMENEZ] discussed the challenges associated with the Software
   Defined Networking (SDN) Transport Automation Platform, including
   observability and analytics requirements, issues with data streaming,
   scalability, diverse models in heterogeneous multi-vendor
   environments, and mechanisms to secure the network management
   protocols.  The presentation also emphasized how advancements in AI
   and machine learning, along with the potential adaptation of
   protocols designed for constrained environments, could drive the next
   evolution in network management.

   Using YANG-Push as an example, [GRAF] highlighted how standards
   development often fails to align with the needs of network operators,
   the constraints of network vendors, and the integration requirements.
   Most critically, it lacks an agile, incremental development process.
   The presentation advocated for adopting an iterative approach to
   standards development, focusing on delivering minimal viable products
   as part of the process.

   [CONTRERAS] emphasized reassessing deployment assumptions and
   incorporating updated operator requirements.  The authors are
   addressing these aspects through
   [I-D.boucadair-nmop-rfc3535-20years-later], leveraging feedback and
   discussions from the workshop.  Some key requirements, suggestions
   and observations were highlighted:

   *  Network software implementations can only happen with a strong,
      committed standardization effort, complemented by active
      involvement in open-source projects that facilitate access to
      code.

   *  Need to rationalize the device model space and avoid redundant
      efforts.  Unlike service and network models, IETF-defined device
      models are not widely implemented.

   *  Define a reference approach/process for service exposure discovery
      (API discovery).

   *  Outlines set of recommendations for core/key features, along with
      appropriate justifications, that will help foster more
      implementations that meet operators’ needs.

   *  Reassess the value of some IETF proposals, including compared to
      competing or emerging solutions (e.g., gNMI vs. YANG-Push)

   *  Need for a more agile process for the development and maintenance
      of YANG modules in the IETF.  RFCs might not be suited for
      documenting YANG modules.

   *  Consider approaches to ease integration by-design (e.g., protocols
      and data models).

   *  There is a need for a reference specification to translate YANG-
      based data into the knowledge graph (KG).

   *  Consider approaches to help YANG models scale.

   *  Consider programmatic approaches to ensure lossless mappings
      between service/network/device data models.

   *  Consider approaches to ensure reuse/consistent data structure
      across various NM segments.

   *  Some networks have specific network management requirements such
      as the need for asynchronous operations or constraints on data
      compactness.

   *  There is a necessity to handle the heterogeneity of data,
      configuration, and network management/requirements.  Resolving
      such issues could draw on insights from parallel technical fields
      such as knowledge engineering practices and concepts associated
      with Linked Data in the Semantic Web, areas where it is common to
      manage problems of heterogeneity and data reconciliation across
      various application domains.

   *  Consider having YANG as part of the protocol specification/change
      where possible, or have the YANG document progress in parallel.

   *  Need to ease the integration of low-level/network-oriented
      solutions with native "IT tooling"

   *  Ease exposure of libraries and host tools (e.g., yangkit) to ease
      integration.

   *  Focus on tooling is needed, especially on the client side.

   *  Create an eco-system where data and networking engineers can
      collaborate.

   *  The distinct approaches followed in both the compute and the
      network environments to define suitable mechanisms for enabling an
      efficient interplay, while highly automating the overall service
      delivery procedure.

   *  The target application/applicability of a network management
      approach should be documented.

   *  Readily available API specifications could be generalized from
      YANG modules for fast development, prototyping, and validation.

3.2.2.  Survey

   As outlined in Section 2, the workshop program committee organized
   outreach initiatives to gather direct feedback and conducted a
   survey.  [SURVEY-INSIGHTS] provided an overview of the respondents’
   backgrounds, as well as insights into the most widely used tools,
   protocols, and APIs for configuration, monitoring, and other network
   operations.  Notably, the survey revealed that Ansible and CLI are
   the most popular configuration tools, NETCONF is the preferred
   configuration protocol, and Prometheus and SNMP are widely used for
   monitoring.  The survey also captured feedback on network automation
   and streaming telemetry.  Issues and future requirements such as
   scalability, performance, the need for easier mapping of various
   models, tooling, management of legacy devices, collaboration with
   open-source, and vendor-specific issues were highlighted.
   Additionally, valuable insights from direct operator feedback were
   also presented (see Appendix A).

3.2.3.  Discussion

   The Session II open discussion featured feedback from implementers,
   highlighting the difficulty in moving to YANG and mapping to vendor
   implementations and how divergence in the implementations creates
   complexity and necessitates workarounds.  Implementations need to
   support standard models alongside native vendor models, which adds
   complexity and leads to confusion.  Challenges were highlighted in
   mapping standard models to internal device models and legacy devices,
   with some cases where mapping is not feasible at all (device-specific
   knobs).  The conversation also emphasized the importance of
   developing open-source reference implementations, compliance and
   interoperability testing for vendors with real data, and better
   quality of vendor implementation and documentation.  The
   implementation and support of multiple models (IETF, OpenConfig, and
   native) is an unavoidable reality in network management.
   Additionally, since the services offered by operators vary
   significantly, reaching a consensus on a common service model within
   the IETF can be a challenging task.  It was also noted that the IETF
   should expedite the publication of standards as well as consider
   gating them with multiple interoperable implementations.

3.3.  Session III: Future (possible solutions, recommendations and next
      steps)

   The final day of the workshop centred on exploring potential future
   solutions and identifying key takeaways, recommendations, and next
   steps.  At the end of day three, to conclude the workshop the chairs
   worked to summarize the key takeaways (see Section 3.4) that garnered
   consensus among the participants.

3.3.1.  Future Directions

   [CLAISE] highlighted the challenges of integrating data models across
   different silos, protocols, and data structures, emphasizing the need
   for a machine-readable approach to expose semantics.  Additionally,
   the related tools being developed and showcased in the IETF
   Hackathons, along with the various challenges in mapping across
   protocols and models, were discussed.  A potential solution was
   proposed using a knowledge graph based on the Semantic Web Stack,
   along with the need to define a basic ontology for the networking
   domain in an iterative manner (outside of RFCs).

   [WATSEN] recommends prioritizing the following areas in four
   recommendations: (1) using RESTCONF+JSON (including YANG-Push Lite)
   as a single protocol beyond network management, (2) utilizing Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) model, (3) creating data
   model adapters (off-box so that common standard models can be
   developed in parallel to the required device "native" models), and
   (4) defining device protocol adapters (with RESTCONF-like NBI for a
   common shared-by-all repository).

   [WILTON] recommends reducing unnecessary complexity, delivering
   timely solutions, fostering open collaboration between vendors and
   operators, prioritizing simplicity, and converging to a single model/
   protocol (though this was discussed as difficult to accomplish).
   Practical suggestions include focusing on YANG-Push Lite, introducing
   YANG 2.0 through incremental updates, developing NETCONFv2, and
   managing IETF YANG models as code or APIs rather than embedding them
   within RFCs.

3.3.2.  Discussion

   The Session III open discussion delved into the absence of NMDA in
   OpenConfig and if the resulting complexity is needed, the history of
   introducing gNMI in the IETF (whether RESTCONF offers any advantage
   over it), and the challenges that building consensus on the common
   ground takes time (without short-cutting the consensus building
   process) and practicality of converging on a single protocol (and it
   is practical).  Emphasize off-box adapters, allowing vendors to
   continue innovating and developing native models rapidly.  One
   suggestion that attracted a lot of discussions centred on developing
   a standard model mapping to native models that could be maintained in
   a common repository, enabling the community to assess coverage and
   alignment.  Further, the discussion explored alternative approaches
   to YANG models within the IETF but outside of RFCs, such as
   leveraging GitHub to accelerate the process (along with the
   challenges associated with it), living documents within the WG
   charter, and supporting academia to take up the open source efforts
   such as device adapters.  The discussion emphasized the need for
   process experimentation, particularly at the working group or area
   level where we could have consensus among the YANG/OPS community on
   how we iterate in WGs without IETF/RFC-wide changes but making sure
   the operators are involved in the process.  Conversations ensued
   around questions asked such as "Is YANG applicable beyond network
   management?" and "Can applications adopt YANG as a modelling language
   to define their services?"

   Some key recommendations made by operators during outreach
   (Section 2) are listed in Appendix B.

3.4.  Key Takeaways

   At the end of the third day, the discussion turned to key takeaways
   that have high-level consensus.  These were live edited during the
   last discussion of the workshop and anything that did not reach wide
   consensus was moved into a "future considerations" list
   (Section 3.4.5).

3.4.1.  Ecosystem conclusions

   The following takeaways try to document the general thinking of the
   participants with respect to the entire Network Management ecosystem
   as it exists today.

   1.  The current network management protocols, models and tools still
       fail the ‘ease of use’ requirement.  Participants noted that the
       tools almost matter more than the protocols.

   2.  The overall ecosystem is still fragmented for both protocols and
       data models.  SNMP is still used extensively for monitoring, and
       the CLI is still heavily relied on in many networks.  Popular
       protocols include SNMP, CLI, NETCONF, RESTCONF, gNMI, etc.

   3.  Documentation about the architecture and usage of the network
       management ecosystem is lacking.  More work is needed to create
       general architecture documentation, deployment guides, tutorials,
       training material, and getting-started guides.

   4.  Transitioning between network management frameworks is
       challenging, just like it is for transitioning between other
       protocols like IPv4 to IPv6.

   5.  Model-driven network management is generally a success where it
       has been implemented and is possible to use.

   6.  More easily usable network management tools for the operators are
       needed.  The lack of open-source tools is seen as a barrier to
       adoption.  Tools need good use cases, example flows and better
       analysis of when and how they work and have been successful.

3.4.2.  Protocol conclusions

   The following conclusions came while discussing Network Management
   protocols more specifically.

   1.  Netconf and YANG are not used much for monitoring tasks.

   2.  Netconf and YANG do not have full coverage on many devices.

   3.  Polling-based solutions are still frequently deployed.  Push-
       based solutions are often desired but are not yet widely
       available.

3.4.3.  Modeling conclusions

   The following conclusions came while discussing Network Management
   modeling more specifically.

   1.  Some YANG models can become too complex, though not as a fault of
       the language itself.

   2.  Multi-vendor compatibility support is required.

   3.  Even vendor-specific features, not just standardized protocol
       features, need to be exposed through network management models
       and protocols for a network management ecosystem to be viable.

   4.  Greater support for service-level modeling is needed.  Device
       level modeling can be a building block to achieve a sufficient
       service-level model, but is not a complete solution by itself.

   5.  Network configuration needs to be verifiable to ensure any
       potential changes can be accepted by devices.  Model translation
       adapters (likely performed on the management station, not the end
       device) may be the best path forward to simultaneously achieve
       this and the goal of supporting one configuration set across a
       diversity of devices with different internal models.

3.4.4.  Standardization conclusions

   The following conclusions came while discussing the best ways to
   standardize network management protocols and associated models.

   1.  A methodology of rapid model development procedures is needed to
       ensure model deployment can keep pace with new feature
       deployment.  We need a solution that significantly increases the
       speed and predictable timeline for developing and publishing
       models within the IETF.  New approaches and methods to make
       models live outside of published RFCs should be explored.  An
       experiment should be started to test a new rapid development
       approach.

   2.  Protocol and model complexity should be reduced to keep additions
       and changes to a minimal set of agreed-upon core features.

   3.  More standardization focus is needed on the scalability of the
       different roles of network management: monitoring, configuration,
       notifications.

   4.  Enhancements to network management protocols and models need to
       be backed by real-world operator use cases and expected adoption
       by vendors.  Vendors and operators will need to work together to
       ensure these goals are appropriately met.

3.4.5.  Conclusions that did not reach consensus during the takeaways
        discussion

   Here we list the things that the group realized needed significantly
   more attention in order to come to a conclusion while updating the
   key takeaways in real time.

   1.  Some, but not all, saw NETCONF for configuration as being
       successful in some larger-scale deployments.  Although this
       statement is true in some contexts, many operators indicated
       their need to rely on other forms of access to manage their
       networks, such as CLIs, Expect scripts, and other protocols.

   2.  Many hope that NETCONF, and RESTCONF more specifically, will
       continue to move to a long-term configuration management
       solution.  However, some participants doubted whether the
       protocol and its data models can ever be truly ubiquitous and
       keep pace with the device deployment pace.

   While many other items also need further discussion, this list
   specifically includes those that were actively discussed during the
   live editing session in the workshop.

4.  Not Covered in the Workshop

   Some topics absent from the workshop discussions included tooling
   (what is currently missing) and strategies to support tool
   development (who pays, who develops, who maintains).  The primary
   focus of the discussion was on YANG and NETCONF/RESTCONF, while
   several other network management protocols and techniques currently
   used received less attention during the workshop.  The discussion
   during the workshop on possible future directions prioritized
   improving existing solutions rather than introducing entirely new
   ones (such as enabling intelligence in network management).

Appendix A.  Insights from Operator Feedback

A.1.  General Insights

   1.  In network deployments, operations are typically at the bottom of
       the ladder.  It's the most squeezed for time and resources.
       Network engineers are not typically seasoned developers.  The
       development of needed in-house tools often takes years to
       develop.  There is a need for tools that are easy to use and just
       work.

   2.  Vast majority of smaller operators use CLI and open source to
       manage their networks.

   3.  There is debate fatigue.  The protocol/model debate is a
       recurring conversation.  The problem isn’t going away.

   4.  It was suggested that other domains (e.g., K8N/automation) are
       years ahead of the current network engineering stack.

   5.  Support for multiple friendly, stable and feature rich libraries
       for programming languages is needed.  Many DevOps routines use
       shell scripts, others use a high-level programming language.  In
       any case, on the client side, multiple programming languages are
       used.

   6.  Screen scraping is both necessary and evil.  This most often
       occurs when interacting with a device having only a CLI.

   7.  It was noted that there could be an outreach to Academia to
       establish programs to teach lessons using modern management
       stacks, and then a new generation of engineers could be helping
       to improve tooling and automation, with university (and/or IETF)
       hackathons.

A.2.  Data Models

   1.  In some network deployments, the focus is solely on service-level
       models, such that device-level protocols and device-level models
       are unimportant.  This assumes the existence of a device
       adaptation layer to transcode service-level models to device-
       level models and conform to the device-specific protocol.

   2.  There is a need for solutions to not hide vendor-specific knobs.
       Currently, vendors compete by differentiating their offerings in
       unique ways.  The reason why an Operator may choose a particular
       vendor is because of its differentiating features.  Whilst
       standard models enable conformance, they must not hide the
       vendor-specific knobs.  YANG deviations are a partial solution to
       not hiding vendor knobs.

   3.  It was emphasized that streaming telemetry requires picking a
       model and sticking with it.  It is quite a commitment and the
       current environment makes the decision harder.

   4.  It was noted that IETF's focus should be on defining abstract/
       service-level data models since it is the only thing the
       community may ever agree on.

   5.  There was a point about navigating non-device-specific models
       being difficult.  If understood correctly, the Network Engineer
       knows the CLI command but has trouble grepping for it in YANG
       modules defined by SDOs.

   6.  There was a wish that IETF and OpenConfig models would merge.

Appendix B.  Key Recommendations from Operator Feedback

   Various recommendations were made by the operators during the
   outreach events.  The key ones presented during the workshop were
   (there were lot more collected):

   *  Everyone: Continue to focus on model-driven management as a means
      to achieve automation.

   *  SDOs: Re-introduce “running code” as part of the specification
      verification process.

   *  Operators: Be actively involved with the “running code” efforts.

   *  IETF: Recommend a solution stack for common use cases.

   *  Ambassadors: Evangelize the recommended solution stack for common
      cases.

   *  Vendors: Support the recommended approach to solution stack for
      common cases.
