1.  Introduction

   The IAB organized a workshop in June 2002 to establish a dialog
   between network operators and protocol developers, and to guide IETF
   when working on network management protocols.  The outcome of that
   w[...]

   Those requirements were instrumental in developing first the NETCONF
   protocol (in the NETCONF Working Group) [RFC6241], the associated
   YANG data modeling language (in the NETMOD Working Group)
   [RFC795[...]

   The NEMOPS workshop aimed to discuss the following key topics:

   *  Review the outcomes and results of the 2002 workshop (current
      deployments, state of the art) and identify any operational
      barriers that prevent these technologies from being widely
      implemented (limi[...]

   *  Sketch new requirements for future network management operations
      in a collaborative manner with the industry, network operators,
      and protocol engineers.

   *  Develop a plan of action and recommendations for the IETF.
